R001,"Working on these assignments taught me a lot about generative AI's capabilities and limitations. At first, I was impressed by how well ChatGPT could structure academic arguments. However, I quickly discovered that it often fabricates references that look legitimate but don't exist. This forced me to verify every single source, which actually made the process slower than doing it manually. I learned that AI can be helpful for brainstorming and drafting, but it requires constant critical evaluation. The biggest lesson was that AI should support my thinking, not replace it."
R002,"These assignments gave me practical experience with AI tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT. Initially, I used them to generate quick summaries of research papers, which saved time. But I noticed the summaries often missed crucial methodological details and nuanced arguments. When I tried using AI for literature reviews, it produced convincing-looking citations that turned out to be completely made up. I also became more aware of the ethical implications - questions about academic integrity and environmental costs of running these models. Now I use AI more selectively and always double-check its outputs."
R003,"Through experimenting with generative AI, I discovered both its strengths and serious weaknesses. The tool is excellent for overcoming writer's block and creating initial outlines. When I'm stuck, asking AI to generate different angles on a topic helps me think more creatively. However, I've learned to never trust AI-generated facts or references without verification. In one assignment, I almost submitted work with three fake citations before catching them. The experience taught me that AI is best used as a brainstorming partner, not as an authoritative source. Critical thinking became more important, not less."
R004,"My perspective on AI in academic work has evolved significantly. At the start, I viewed these tools with suspicion, worried they would undermine genuine learning. After using them intentionally, I see more nuance. AI helped me structure arguments more efficiently and explore topics from multiple perspectives. However, the outputs lack depth - they give you breadth without substance. I found myself learning more by critically evaluating AI's mistakes than by using its correct outputs. The key insight is that engaging with AI can actually enhance critical thinking if you approach it with the right mindset."
R005,"The most striking discovery was how confidently AI presents false information. ChatGPT gave me references with proper formatting, author names, and publication years - all completely fabricated. This made me realize how important source verification is. Beyond accuracy issues, I also considered broader implications like energy consumption and labor practices behind these tools. While AI speeds up certain tasks like creating first drafts or generating study questions, the time saved is often spent on fact-checking. I've concluded that AI works best as an assistive tool for specific, well-defined tasks rather than as a comprehensive research assistant."
