R001,"Working on these assignments taught me a lot about generative AI's capabilities and limitations. At first, I was impressed by how well ChatGPT could structure academic arguments. However, I quickly...","Discovered that AI produces well-structured academic text but frequently fabricates sources, requiring verification of every reference. Shifted from initial enthusiasm about AI's capabilities to recognizing it as a supportive tool that demands critical evaluation. Learned to use AI for brainstorming and drafting while maintaining personal responsibility for accuracy and authenticity.","Discovered that AI produces well-structured academic text but frequently fabricates sources, requiring verification of every reference.","Discovered that AI produces well-structured academic text but frequently fabricates sources, requiring verification of every reference., Learned to use AI for brainstorming and drafting while maintaining personal responsibility for accuracy and authenticity."
R002,"These assignments gave me practical experience with AI tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT. Initially, I used them to generate quick summaries of research papers, which saved time. But I noticed the su...","Learned that AI summaries save time but often omit crucial methodological details and nuanced arguments. Discovered fabricated citations that appeared legitimate, highlighting verification needs. Became aware of broader ethical and environmental concerns, leading to more selective and responsible AI use.","Learned that AI summaries save time but often omit crucial methodological details and nuanced arguments.","Learned that AI summaries save time but often omit crucial methodological details and nuanced arguments., Became aware of broader ethical and environmental concerns, leading to more selective and responsible AI use."
R003,"Through experimenting with generative AI, I discovered both its strengths and serious weaknesses. The tool is excellent for overcoming writer's block and creating initial outlines. When I'm stuck, ask...","Found AI particularly useful for overcoming writer's block and generating multiple perspectives on topics. Shifted from treating AI as an information source to using it as a brainstorming partner after discovering fake citations. Learned that verification is essential and that critical thinking becomes more, not less, important when using AI.","Found AI particularly useful for overcoming writer's block and generating multiple perspectives on topics.","Found AI particularly useful for overcoming writer's block and generating multiple perspectives on topics., Learned that verification is essential and that critical thinking becomes more, not less, important when using AI."
R004,"My perspective on AI in academic work has evolved significantly. At the start, I viewed these tools with suspicion, worried they would undermine genuine learning. After using them intentionally, I see...","Evolved from initial suspicion to recognizing AI's value for structuring arguments and exploring multiple perspectives. Discovered that AI outputs lack analytical depth, providing breadth without substance. Learned that critically evaluating AI's errors can be more educational than using correct outputs, enhancing rather than replacing critical thinking.","Evolved from initial suspicion to recognizing AI's value for structuring arguments and exploring multiple perspectives.","Evolved from initial suspicion to recognizing AI's value for structuring arguments and exploring multiple perspectives., Learned that critically evaluating AI's errors can be more educational than using correct outputs, enhancing rather than replacing critical thinking."
R005,"The most striking discovery was how confidently AI presents false information. ChatGPT gave me references with proper formatting, author names, and publication years - all completely fabricated. This ...","Discovered that AI presents false information with complete confidence, including fabricated references with authentic-looking formatting. Became aware of environmental and labor concerns beyond accuracy issues. Learned that time saved on drafting is offset by fact-checking needs, concluding AI works best for specific, well-defined assistive tasks rather than comprehensive research.","Discovered that AI presents false information with complete confidence, including fabricated references with authentic-looking formatting.","Discovered that AI presents false information with complete confidence, including fabricated references with authentic-looking formatting., Learned that time saved on drafting is offset by fact-checking needs, concluding AI works best for specific, well-defined assistive tasks rather than comprehensive research."
